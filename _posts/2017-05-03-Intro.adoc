Marko Kunic <kunicmarko20@gmail.com>


As you already know, my name is Marko Kunic. Currently I am a PHP developer working with Symfony, Wordpress and Drupal, so for now you can expect my blog posts to be related to that and anything that pops in between. Through time, I encountered the problems where stackoverflow didn't have a solution and a lot of google pages after I find some random blog that has a solution. To contribute back my goal is to post about solutions that wasted my time so hopefully the next person that has the same problem runs into this blog and finds what they were looking for.
